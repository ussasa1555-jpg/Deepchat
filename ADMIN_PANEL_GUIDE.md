## 🚨 ADMIN ABUSE PREVENTION

### **Auto-Detection Patterns:**

**1. Rapid Banning:**
```
Trigger: 5+ bans in 10 minutes
Action: 
  - Auto-timeout admin for 24h
  - Management alert (critical)
  - All recent bans reviewed
```

**2. Targeting Specific User:**
```
Trigger: Same admin acts on same user 3+ times
Action:
  - Flag as harassment
  - Management alert (warning)
  - Require Management approval for future actions
```

**3. Off-Hours Activity:**
```
Trigger: Admin activity 2-6 AM
Action:
  - Log as suspicious
  - Require 2FA re-verification
  - Management alert (info)
```

**4. Quota Exceeded:**
```
Trigger: Admin attempts 6th ban/hour
Action:
  - Block action
  - Auto-timeout 24h
  - Management alert (critical)
```
