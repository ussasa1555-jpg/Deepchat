## 🚀 DEPLOYMENT STEPS

### **1. Run Migration (REQUIRED):**
```sql
-- Supabase SQL Editor:
supabase/migrations/20251017000002_admin_system.sql
→ RUN (Takes ~5 seconds)

-- Verify:
SELECT * FROM admin_quotas LIMIT 1;
-- Should return table structure ✅
```

### **2. Create First Management:**
```sql
-- Manual DB query (one-time):
UPDATE users 
SET role = 'management' 
WHERE email = 'your-email@example.com';

-- Verify:
SELECT uid, nickname, role FROM users WHERE role = 'management';
```

### **3. Setup IP Whitelist (Management):**
```sql
-- Add your IP to whitelist:
INSERT INTO ip_whitelist (management_uid, ip_address, label, added_by)
VALUES (
  'YOUR_MANAGEMENT_UID',
  'YOUR_IP_ADDRESS',
  'Home/Office',
  'YOUR_MANAGEMENT_UID'
);

-- Find your IP: https://whatismyipaddress.com/
```

### **4. Enable 2FA (REQUIRED):**
```
1. Login as management
2. /settings → Two-Factor Authentication
3. Enable 2FA → Scan QR or manual entry
4. Verify code → 2FA enabled ✅
5. Now you can access /admin
```

### **5. Test Admin Panel:**
```
1. Navigate to /admin
2. Should see dashboard with stats ✅
3. Try /admin/users → See user list ✅
4. Try /admin/threats → See threats ✅
5. Try /admin/audit-logs → See logs ✅
